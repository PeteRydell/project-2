# Yarn Episode Preview

## Motivation

Content team for a mobile application called Yarn is unable to generate an accurate preview of what the story content will look like before it goes live. This application will help make their work flow more efficient and fluid. 

Live application can be accessed [here](https://serene-spire-61823.herokuapp.com/).
